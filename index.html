                    <h3>Predictive Delivery Time Estimation</h3>
                    <p>Using geographical data, shipping details, and historical order processing times, this project aims to predict delivery times for online orders using machine learning models and techniques.</p>
                    <p>Incorporates Python, NumPy, and Pandas for data preprocessing, Jupyter Notebook for development, and a Random Forest model for training and testing delivery time predictions.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by the need to optimize delivery operations in the e-commerce industry.</p>

                    <h3>Pet Monitoring System</h3>
                    <p>A mini project based on IoT which is used for monitoring our pets when we are not at home. It monitors their health factors like temperature and heart rate, and gives us notification alerts when the pet is making noise (e.g., barking) continuously for some period of time.</p>
                    <p>We made use of ESP8266 microcontroller for this application which supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Blynk IoT was used for making an Android and web app for this monitoring system.</p>
